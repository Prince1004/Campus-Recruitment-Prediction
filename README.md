*Campus Placement*

*Overview*


This project aims to predict student placement status using various machine learning models.In this porject I used Logistic, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, SVM models. and a voting classifier The dataset includes student academic performance and other related features. The primary goal is to build and evaluate different classification models to identify the most effective one for predicting whether a student will be placed or not.

Conclusion

Among the models evaluated, Gradient Boosting stands out with the highest accuracy and ROC-AUC scores, underscoring its superior predictive performance and robustness. This makes it particularly suitable for applications where precision and generalizability are paramount. SVM and Random Forest also perform commendably
